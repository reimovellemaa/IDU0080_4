# Final project for subject IDU0080

## In order to run the application do the following

### First run all the backend classes.
These would be - CouriersApplication, MainWebApplication, OrderApplication, RemoteApplication, SoapApplication

### Secondly run the frontend.
If this is the first time running it, then you'll require npm to install the dependencies. Navigate to the folder "frontend" and type in "npm install".
This will install all the dependencies needed. After the dependencies have finished installing run "npm run start", this will run the frontend.
Once it has finished booting up navigate to localhost:8080 and you should see the application.
